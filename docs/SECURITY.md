# FORGE — Security Model

Scope: a **local, single-user** desktop application. There is no multi-user or enterprise security claim, no
certification, and no remote service. Treat everything below as the implemented local design plus its known limits.

## Trust boundaries

* **Authority** lives in the Rust core only: policy, approvals, persistence, git, process control.
* The **engine** and the **agent** are untrusted-adjacent. The engine can request decisions; it cannot make them.
* **Data is not authority.** Repository files, tool output, web content, memory pages and agent text may contain
  instructions; FORGE renders them as plain text and the agent is told to treat them as data. Nothing in them can
  change policy.
* Approvals can only be answered through the `approval_decide` command from the app's own webview. The agent has no path
  to Tauri IPC. Decisions are single-shot (`UPDATE … WHERE state='pending'`), attributable (`decided_by`, audit event),
  and expire when the session ends.

## Controls implemented (with tests)

| Control | Where | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Every tool call is gated by an SDK `PreToolUse` hook; `canUseTool` is a fail-safe fallback. User-level Claude settings are excluded (`settingSources:['project']`), so a user's global allow-rules/bypass defaults cannot widen what FORGE approved. | `adapters/claude.ts` | live E2E (`live_claude_mission_end_to_end`) |
| Writes outside the worktree and to protected paths (`.git`, `.claude/settings*|hooks|agents|skills`, `.codex`, `.forge`, `.env*`) are **denied by policy**, never prompted, even in `accept_edits`. | `policy.rs` | `policy::tests`, `supervisor::tests::policy_blocks…` |
| `git push` is denied for agents (publishing is a FORGE-controlled step). Best-effort pattern; the real control is human review of shell prompts. | `policy.rs` | `git_push_is_denied_not_asked` |
| Path containment: component-wise, case-insensitive on Windows, `..` and junction/symlink escape, alternate data streams, reserved device names. | `paths.rs` | `paths::tests` (incl. real junction) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry switches are stripped from the engine env, so missions cannot silently bill the API. A non-subscription `credentialSource` is surfaced in the UI. | `adapters/claude.ts` | `normalize.test.ts` |
| Secrets redaction (common token shapes, `key=value` assignments, PEM blocks) before persistence; stderr tails redacted; payloads size-bounded. | `redact.rs`, `util.ts` | `redact::tests` |
| Process containment: Windows Job Object `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` per engine; engine exits when stdin closes; forced tree kill after 8 s on stop. | `proc.rs`, `main.ts`, `supervisor.rs` | `stopping_a_hung_agent…`, host tests |
| Worktree safety: removal refuses when uncommitted/unmerged work exists unless the user confirms the stated loss. | `git.rs`, `supervisor.rs` | `discard_refuses…` |
| Restart honesty: active missions become `interrupted`; pending approvals `expired`. | `supervisor.rs::recover` | `restart_recovery…` |
| Webview CSP; minimal Tauri capabilities (`core:default`, `dialog:allow-open`); no shell/fs/opener plugins exposed to the webview. | `tauri.conf.json`, `capabilities/` | — |

## Known limits (do not assume these are solved)

1. **An approved shell command runs with the user's privileges.** FORGE shows risk warnings but cannot sandbox it. In
   particular an approved command could read or modify `~/.forge/forge.db` or other files outside the worktree.
   Mitigation path: provider sandboxing (Codex sandbox, Claude `sandbox` option) — not enabled yet.
2. Shell-pattern checks (push, destructive commands) are heuristics and can be obfuscated around.
3. Job Object assignment happens just after spawn; a descendant created in that window would escape. The engine's
   self-exit on stdin close is the second line of defence.
4. A repo-committed `.claude/settings.json` is loaded (`settingSources:['project']`), so a malicious repository can add
   hooks or allow-rules that run **inside the provider**. FORGE's PreToolUse hook still runs first for tool calls, but
   repo-defined hooks themselves are code execution on the user's machine. Only register repositories you trust; a
   "project settings trust" gate is planned in Harness Studio.
5. Redaction is best-effort pattern matching.
6. The scripted test agent exists only in debug builds / when `FORGE_ALLOW_FAKE_PROVIDER=1`.

## Provider authentication

FORGE uses the user's existing locally authenticated CLI (`claude`), launched via the official Agent SDK with
`pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`. It never reads, copies or stores provider tokens. Personal-subscription use is for local
development; a distributed commercial/enterprise edition must use provider-approved integration and billing and is
not claimed here.

## Enterprise

Not implemented. Schemas and boundaries are designed for it (see DATA_MODEL.md, ROADMAP.md Phase 7). No SOC 2, SSO, RBAC,
tenant isolation or remote execution exists, and none should be advertised until built and tested.
